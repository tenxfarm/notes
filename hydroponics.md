# Hydroponics

## NFTs

There are two options, closed and open. Open is easier to clean, can be later used with just hydrotons to maximize spacing, instead of fixed holes, and can be used for growing microgreens.

Cost for closed NFT is about 140 per meter and open is 200 per meter. This includes the holes.

End caps will be another 25 rupees. And it will need 2 end caps per nft. The NFT can be bought in 3m, 6m or 7m length. They come in 2 inch or 3.5 inch depth. And 4 inch wide. 

## Flow Rate

How deep should the water be, and how fast should the water be flowing

It is recommended that 1-2 liters of water pass through each channel every minute. While the plants are just seedlings the recommended flow rate can be cut in half, and then increased as the plants get bigger. Flow rates much higher or lower than these have sometimes been associated with nutrient deficiencies. Also nutrient deficiencies have sometimes been seen when growing tubes (channel/gully) are longer than 30 to 40 feet (10 to 15 meters). However it's been shown that having a second nutrient feed line half way down the growing tube (channel/gully) eliminates that issue.

The slope of the channel controls how fast the water goes through the tube/channel (not the water pump or).

The recommended slope for a N.F.T. system is typically a 1:30 to 1:40 ratio. That is for every 30 to 40 inches of horizontal length, one inch of drop (slope) is recommended. We recommend when designing your N.F.T. systems, you design it so you can adjust the slope while the plants are still growing. That's because as the root systems get bigger, they may cause it to pool and dam up the water flow. If it's adjustable you can tilt it more to compensate if needed.Â  Also when building your N.F.T. systems, try and keep the channels/gully's as true as possible. If they sag in spots, water will pool up in those areas.
